# Transfer_learning-in-StackExchange
A informatory project on text preprocessing and tag prediction based on the content and title of each sample.
The data needed to be cleaned throughly for any useless strings of words to not interefere with the tag prediction.
Basic use of Physics corpus and efficient data cleaning tools( e.g. Nltk,BeautifulSoup,re,string) got the job done.
The efficient preprocessing helped us create a clean dataset for analysing...
#Plan:
1. Tag prediction on basis of content
2. Tag prediction on basis of title.

#Result
On the basis of content created a output file with tags prediction which got top 100 rank(76 top be precise)
Whereas on basis of Title created a file with tag prediction efficient enough to fetch a rank #45!
